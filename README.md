# symfony5-docker-setup

### This set of files makes it possible to obtain a functional configuration (without doubt improving) of Docker containers embedding PHP7.4, Mysql 8.0, PHPMyAdmin, Nginx.
### You also have the option of installing Node.js. To do this, once your Symfony project is created, install the Encore pack.

### All contributions are welcome :-)

### Good Dev ;-)
